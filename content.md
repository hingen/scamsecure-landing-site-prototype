## What should I do if I fall victim to a phishing scam?

The actions to take depends on what information you provided to the scammer. If unsure of the best course of action, contact the affected services or relevant authorities and take the steps recommended by them.

Some commonly stolen information and recommended steps to take include:

- Password<br/>Change your password for all accounts that uses the same password. Scammers will often try to use stolen login credentials on multiple sites as users have a tendency to reuse passwords.

- Credit Card Information<br/>Report the incident to your bank or credit card company. They will often advise you on the steps to take. This may include obtaining a new card, and disputing unauthorised transactions, if any have been made.

- Personal Information<br/>Be on the lookout for follow-up scams. Scammers may exploit these information to craft more convincing scams targetted specifically at you. Scammers may also target the people you know if such information was provided to them.
